GreenStitch Backend Assignment 
First of all i want to mention that i learned SpringBoot on version 2.7 but now its updated to version 3.So now a lot of things are deprecated which makes it hard to implement all these things so i tried best to implement within given time.

I was having issues with H2 database as i never used it before so i tried implementation with MYSQL. Added default users when application starts.

2 main API'S created as "register" and "/authenticate".

Added jwt dependencies.
